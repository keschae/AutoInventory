## AutoInventory Application

This is a Java application that I wrote when developing an assignment for IT 168 at Illinois State. There were several objectives this assignment had to meet. Specifically, it needed to address:

 * Make use of equals and toString methods
 * Utilize aggregate classes
 * Objects stored in an array
 * Array sorting and searching
 * Text file reading

JavaDoc comments are spread throughout. They could use a little refinement.

The program reads and parses a text file. Along the way it creates aggregate objects made from the Customer and Automobile classes and assigns those positions in an array. After loading the file into an array of objects a menu is presented and 6 choices are given. The user can do various things like sort the list or search for a matching VIN number and print out various reports in a format that was specified. Students are encouraged to leverage the toString methods whenever possible for display output. As with all coding solutions it could be done dozens of different ways. But given what students are supposed to know at this stage in their learning this program seemed very appropriate to me.

Feel free to utilize it for any learning/educational environment usage.
